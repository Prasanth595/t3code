# Product usage data

The T3 Code server sends product usage events to PostHog, associated with a hashed account or
installation identifier. Events include the provider, model, reasoning effort, permission mode,
turn result, duration, and main-agent token totals when available.

Events do not include prompts, responses, file contents, authentication tokens, conversation IDs,
raw provider events, or child-agent output. Child-agent token use is excluded from the totals.

To disable collection, turn off **Settings → General → Privacy → Share usage data**
on web or desktop. On mobile, use **Settings → Privacy**. Choose the environments
to change in the settings filter. This is an environment-wide preference, not a device or project
preference, and applies immediately without restarting. Disabling collection discards queued
product events; enabling it again collects only future events. An upload already in progress
cannot be recalled. This does not control provider telemetry or your OpenTelemetry exports.

You can also set `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` in the server's environment before
starting it. This always disables collection, even when the saved setting allows it. Settings
shows the switch off and unavailable with **Disabled by environment variable** on affected
environments. The preference applies to every client connected to that environment, not just
the device where you changed it.

The desktop app reads the variable from your shell profile (for example `~/.zshrc`) on macOS and
Linux, so export it there and restart the app. On Windows, set it as a user environment variable.

## Export diagnostics to your own receiver

To send traces, metrics, or logs to an OpenTelemetry receiver, open
**Settings > General > Diagnostics**, select an environment, and enter each signal's OTLP HTTP
endpoint under **OpenTelemetry export** (for example `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Save, then
restart that environment's server. The receiver must be reachable from the server's machine.
**Test** sends an empty export from the server to check an endpoint before or after you save it;
saved endpoints are checked when the section opens. Checks send authentication headers only to
the signal's currently running endpoint and do not follow redirects. To check a new endpoint
that requires authentication, save it and restart the server first.

`T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL` and standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` environment variables override the saved
settings. For endpoints saved here or set with `T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL`, set `T3CODE_OTLP_HEADERS` for
receivers that need authentication and `T3CODE_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` for receivers that do
not accept JSON. An endpoint set with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` takes its headers and protocol from
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` instead.
